        <h1>I Belong There by Mahmoud Darwish</h1>

        <p>I belong there. I have many memories.</p>
        
        <p>I was born as everyone is born.</p>
        
        <p>I have a mother, a house with many windows, brothers, friends, and a prison cell
            with a chilly window! </p>
        
        <p>I have a saturated meadow. In the deep horizon of my word, I have a moon,
            a bird's sustenance, and an immortal olive tree.</p>
        
        <p>I have lived on the land long before swords turned man into prey.
            I belong there. When heaven mourns for her mother, I return heaven to
            her mother.</p>
        
        <p>And I cry so that a returning cloud might carry my tears.</p>
        
        <p>To break the rules, I have learned all the words needed for a trial by blood.
            I have learned and dismantled all the words in order to draw from them a
            single word: Home.</p>
